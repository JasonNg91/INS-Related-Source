RoNIN: Robust Neural Inertial Navigation in the Wild: Benchmark, Evaluations, and New Methods
30 May 2019  Â·  Hang Yan, Sachini Herath, Yasutaka Furukawa
This paper sets a new foundation for data-driven inertial navigation research, where the task is the estimation of positions and orientations of a moving subject from a sequence of IMU sensor measurements. More concretely, the paper presents 1) a new benchmark containing more than 40 hours of IMU sensor data from 100 human subjects with ground-truth 3D trajectories under natural human motions; 2) novel neural inertial navigation architectures, making significant improvements for challenging motion cases; and 3) qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the competing methods over three inertial navigation benchmarks. We will share the code and data to promote further research.

This paper proposes the inertial localization problem, the task of estimating the absolute location from a sequence of inertial sensor measurements. This is an exciting and unexplored area of indoor localization research, where we present a rich dataset with 53 hours of inertial sensor data and the associated ground truth locations. We developed a solution, dubbed neural inertial localization (NILoc) which 1) uses a neural inertial navigation technique to turn inertial sensor history to a sequence of velocity vectors; then 2) employs a transformer-based neural architecture to find the device location from the sequence of velocity estimates. We only use an IMU sensor, which is energy efficient and privacy-preserving compared to WiFi, cameras, and other data sources. Our approach is significantly faster and achieves competitive results even compared with state-of-the-art methods that require a floorplan and run 20 to 30 times slower. We share our code, model and data at https://sachini.github.io/niloc.
